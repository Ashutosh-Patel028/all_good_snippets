#How to execute C++ file in CMD(Command Prompt) Windows
>g++ fileName.cpp
-this will compile cpp file
>a
or 
>a.exe
-this will execute file
*if output fileName is not specified then g++ compiler by default set output fileName to 'a.exe'

#Some more compiler Option in g++ compiler
>g++ fileName.cpp -o OutputFile
*this will compile c++ file and set output file Name as 'OutputFile'
>OutputFile.exe     (or)     >OutputFile
*this will run output file in CMD

>g++ fileName.cpp -o OutputFile && OutputFile.exe<input.txt>output.txt
* This will first compile c++ file and set output file to 'OutputFile' and then it will execute ouputfile as well and it will take
input from 'input.txt' and put any outcome to  'output.txt'
