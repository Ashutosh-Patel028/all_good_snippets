gps module
connection:
Rx(gps)<->Rx(arduino)
Tx(gps)<->Tx(arduino)
Vcc(gps)<->3.3V(arduino)
GND(gps)<->GND(arduino)

voltage supply required: 3.3V (MAX)
Default baud rate from gps chip is 9600.
Cold Start -> searching for satellite to get stablized data.

GPGLL->Geo Position Latitute and Longitude.
NMEA sentences ->Protocol most of GPS use to read latitude and longitude
NMEA=(National Marine Electronics Association)-> standard data format supported by GPS manufacturers
=>If you are using Tx and Rx pin of arduino for serial communication rather than any other digital pin->
NOTE:
/*
before uploading the code to arduino
disconnect Tx and Rx pins connection from arduino to GPS module(Neo-8m)
then after uploading code to arduino, connect again Tx,Rx pins to arduino.
*/
=>Serial communication is must for transferring GPS location from GPS module to arduino's serial port.
