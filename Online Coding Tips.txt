Max size of array in cpp can be -> ~10^7 order(when array is declared globally)
Max size of array in cpp (when declared inside main() funtion) -> ~10^5 order
#Global arrays are 0 initialised by default.

*****Iterations vs Time taken to run program in Online Coding Judges****
Iterations ---> Time taken
10^7 ----> 1 sec
10^8 ----> 10 sec
10^9 ----> 100 sec ~= 1 min
10^10----> 1000 sec ~= 15 min
.......
....... so on


******Rough Ranges of dataTypes in C++*******
int : -10^9 to 10^9 			Exactly=> INT_MIN<=int<=INT_MAX
long int : -10^12 to 10^12
long long int: -10^18 to 10^18


##calculation in c++ always takes place in higher data type among operands:
exp1-> double d = 7/3;		//output:2
becaz 7 and 3 are both int so output(7/3) as int is 2 which is later stored in double variable d.
exp2-> double d = 7/3.0;	//output:2.33333
becaz here 7 is int and 3.0 is double, so higher datatype is double hence calculation is converted into double(2.33333) and then stored in double varible d.
exp3-> int a=100000,b=100000;
       cout<<a*b<<endl;	//output:garbage value
becaz a and b are integer value so a*b is also integer value but multiplication exceeds integer range, so results in garabge value.
soln: cout<<a*1LL*b; //output: 10^10(correct)   -> becaz 1LL converts int to long long type and output lies in LL range.
